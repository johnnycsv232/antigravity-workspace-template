# IronClad Sales Playbook Context

> Auto-injected context for sales and outreach workflows.

## Elevator Pitches

**10-Second:** "IronClad helps contractors capture every missed call. Our AI texts leads back in under 10 seconds — before they call the next guy."

**30-Second:** "I work with HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing companies in Minneapolis. Most don't realize they're missing 40% of inbound calls — and 85% never call back. IronClad texts missed callers in under 10 seconds. No contracts. 48-hour setup. Pays for itself after one job."

## ROI Formula

```
Missed Calls/Week × 4 × 30% Close Rate × Avg Ticket = Monthly Revenue at Risk
```

| Missed/Week | $800 ticket | $1,200 ticket |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | $4,800/mo | $7,200/mo |
| 10 | $9,600/mo | $14,400/mo |
| 15 | $14,400/mo | $21,600/mo |

## Objection Responses

| Objection | Response |
|---|---|
| "Too expensive" | "How much does a $1,200 job cost when the caller goes to voicemail? IronClad costs a fraction of one lost job." |
| "I don't miss many calls" | "Industry data shows ~40% go unanswered. Can I run a free 2-minute response-time analysis?" |
| "My voicemail works fine" | "85% of callers don't leave a voicemail — they just call the next company." |
| "I don't trust AI" | "The AI sends a text you've pre-approved — it doesn't replace you." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Let me send a free response-time analysis so you have real data — no strings attached." |

**Golden Rule:** Never argue. Acknowledge → Reframe → Offer proof.
