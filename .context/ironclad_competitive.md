| Competitor | Type | Price | IronClad Advantage |

| Sameday AI | AI receptionist | $349+/mo | IronClad is 50%+ cheaper at Pro tier |
| GoHighLevel | CRM + missed-call feature | $97–$497/mo | Overkill for most shops; IronClad is simpler |

## IronClad Moat

1. **Speed** — under 10 seconds (48x faster than industry average 8+ hours)
2. **Home-service focus** — qualification scripts built for HVAC/plumbing
3. **Hyper-local** — Minneapolis/Hennepin County expertise
4. **Zip exclusivity** — one contractor per zip = monopoly positioning
5. **Simplicity** — no CRM switch, no phone system change
6. **Zero risk** — no contract, 48-hour setup

## Market Size (Minnesota)

- TAM: $3B HVAC market (IBISWorld)
- Hennepin County: 200+ licensed contractors
- Year 1 SOM: 5–10 clients = $11,820–$23,640 MRR
- Missed calls cost contractors: $26K–$126K/year

## Anti-Sherlocking Risk: LOW

- Twilio/Google not building this
- ServiceTitan/Housecall Pro focus on dispatch, not missed-call capture
- IronClad's moat: local exclusivity + contractor-specific qualification
