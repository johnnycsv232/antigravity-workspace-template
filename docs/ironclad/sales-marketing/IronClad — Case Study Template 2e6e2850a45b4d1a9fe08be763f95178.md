## 🛡️ How [Business Name] Recovered $[X] in Lost Revenue with IronClad

### The Client

**[Business Name]** is a [industry] company in [city/area] with [X employees]. They handle [types of jobs] and rely heavily on inbound phone calls for new business.

### The Problem

Before IronClad, [Business Name] was missing an estimated **[X] calls per week** — mostly after hours, on weekends, and during busy job periods. With no after-hours answering system, those callers hit voicemail. And **85% of them never called back.**

At an average job ticket of **$[X]**, that translated to roughly **$[X]/month in lost revenue** they didn't even know about.

### The Solution

[Business Name] signed up for IronClad and was **live within 48 hours.** Setup included:

- Custom AI text-back message matching their brand and services
- Call-forwarding configured for after-hours and busy/no-answer
- Lead qualification flow capturing service type, urgency, and contact info
- Real-time SMS notifications for every captured lead

### The Results (First 30 Days)

| **Metric** | **Before IronClad** | **After IronClad** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Missed calls responded to | ~15% | **100%** |
| Avg response time | 4+ hours (or never) | **< 10 seconds** |
| Leads captured / month | Unknown | **[X]** |
| Jobs booked from captured leads | 0 | **[X]** |
| Estimated revenue recovered | $0 | **$[X]** |

### The Quote

> *"[Client quote about their experience — keep it specific and results-focused. Example: 'We had no idea how many calls we were missing. IronClad captured 12 leads in the first two weeks — 4 of them booked jobs. That more than paid for a year of service.']"*
