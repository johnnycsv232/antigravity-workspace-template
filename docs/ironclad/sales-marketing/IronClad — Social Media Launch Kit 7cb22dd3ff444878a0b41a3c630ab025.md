2. **💡 Education** — Teach them something (stats, benchmarks, tips)

### 🔹 First 10 Posts (Ready to Use)

**Post 1 — The Hook** 🔥

> *"80% of callers who hit your voicemail call the next contractor on Google. How many jobs did you lose last week without knowing it?"*
> 

> #MissedCalls #HomeServices #HVAC #Minneapolis
> 

**Post 2 — The Stat** 💡

> *"Businesses miss ~40% of their inbound calls. For a plumber with an $800 average ticket, that's $4,800/month walking out the door. IronClad brings it back."*
> 

**Post 3 — The Story** 🔥

> *"I called 10 HVAC companies in Minneapolis after 6 PM last week. Only 1 responded within an hour. The other 9? Still waiting. If you're one of the 9 — we should talk."*
> 

**Post 4 — How It Works** 🛡️

> *"Miss a call → AI texts back in <10 seconds → Lead captured → You follow up when ready. That's IronClad. 48-hour setup. No contract."*
> 

**Post 5 — The Question** 💡

> *"Quick question for contractors: What happens when a customer calls your shop at 7 PM on a Tuesday? If the answer is 'voicemail' — you're losing money."*
> 

**Post 6 — Speed Matters** 💡

> *"Responding to a lead within 5 minutes = 80% higher conversion. After 30 minutes? You're 10x less likely to connect. Speed wins."*
> 

**Post 7 — The Math** 🔥

> *"5 missed calls/week × $800 avg ticket × 30% close rate = $4,800/month lost. IronClad costs less than one of those jobs."*
> 

**Post 8 — Social Proof** ✅

> *"'We captured 7 leads in our first week that we would've completely missed. Three booked jobs.' — IronClad user, Minneapolis HVAC"*
> 

**Post 9 — Behind the Scenes** 🤝

> *"Building IronClad in Minneapolis because every contractor here deserves to capture every lead. No missed calls. No lost revenue. Let's go."*
> 

**Post 10 — CTA** 🛡️

> *"Want to see how many calls your business is missing? We'll run a free response-time analysis. DM us or drop a 🛡️ below."*
>

### 🔹 Facebook Group Strategy

Join these types of local groups:

- Minneapolis contractor / trade groups
- Hennepin County small business groups
- HVAC / plumbing / electrical trade groups (national)
- Home-service business owner groups

**Rules:**

- **Give value first.** Don't spam. Answer questions, share tips, build trust.
- **Use the "after-hours test" story** as a conversation starter
- **Only pitch when asked** or when there's a natural opening
- **Post the free analysis offer** — it's a soft CTA that works well in groups
