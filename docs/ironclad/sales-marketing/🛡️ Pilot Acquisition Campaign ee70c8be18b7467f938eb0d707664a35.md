### 💡 Strategy

> Call businesses after hours → let their phone ring to voicemail → call them back during business hours and say: *"Hey, I called you last night and nobody answered. Your customers are doing the same thing — except they're calling the next company on Google."*
> 

This creates an undeniable proof point. Then show them IronClad's < 10 second text-back and let the product sell itself.
