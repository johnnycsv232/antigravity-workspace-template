### 🔹 Sequence 1 — The After-Hours Proof (Cold Open)

**Subject:** I called your shop last night…

> Hi [First Name],
> 

> 
> 

> I called [Business Name] last night around 7 PM — it went to voicemail and I never heard back.
> 

> 
> 

> No judgment — that happens to every contractor. But here's the thing: **80% of callers who hit voicemail call the next company on Google.** If that caller was a homeowner with a $1,200 furnace repair? That's revenue walking out the door.
> 

> 
> 

> I run **IronClad** — we help [HVAC / plumbing / electrical / roofing] companies in Minneapolis capture every missed call with AI-powered text-back in under 10 seconds. No contracts. 48-hour setup.
> 

> 
> 

> **Can I send you a free response-time analysis of your business?** It takes 2 minutes to review and shows you exactly where leads are slipping through.
> 

> 
> 

> — [Your Name], IronClad
>

### 🔹 Sequence 2 — The Follow-Up (Day 3)

**Subject:** Quick follow-up — your missed calls

> Hi [First Name],
> 

> 
> 

> Just circling back. I ran a quick analysis on [Business Name]'s response time — and I think you'd find the results interesting.
> 

> 
> 

> The short version: **your average response time to a missed call is [X minutes / never]**, which means a percentage of your leads are going to competitors before you even know they called.
> 

> 
> 

> I'd love to show you exactly how IronClad fixes that — a 5-minute call is all it takes.
> 

> 
> 

> **Would [Tuesday or Thursday] work for a quick chat?**
> 

> 
> 

> — [Your Name], IronClad
>

### 🔹 Sequence 3 — The Value Drop (Day 7)

**Subject:** How [Industry] companies are losing $4K+ per week

> Hi [First Name],
> 

> 
> 

> Quick stat: the average [HVAC / plumbing] company misses **5–10 calls per week**. At an average ticket of $800, that's **$4,000–$8,000 in lost revenue every single week.**
> 

> 
> 

> IronClad's AI texts missed callers back in under 10 seconds — so they stay with you instead of calling the next contractor.
> 

> 
> 

> **Here's what one of our clients said after Week 1:**
> 

> *"We captured 7 leads in our first week that we would've completely missed. Three of them booked jobs."*
> 

> 
> 

> No contract. No risk. 48-hour setup.
> 

> 
> 

> Interested? Just reply "yes" and I'll send over the details.
> 

> 
> 

> — [Your Name], IronClad
>

### 🔹 Sequence 4 — The Breakup Email (Day 14)

**Subject:** Should I close your file?

> Hi [First Name],
> 

> 
> 

> I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back — totally understand, you're busy running a business.
> 

> 
> 

> I'll assume the timing isn't right and won't keep bugging you. But if you ever want to see how many leads you're missing after hours, the offer for a **free response-time analysis** stands.
> 

> 
> 

> Just reply anytime and I'll have it ready in 24 hours.
> 

> 
> 

> All the best,
> 

> [Your Name], IronClad
