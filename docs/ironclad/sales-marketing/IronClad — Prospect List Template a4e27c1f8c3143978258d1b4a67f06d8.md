| Call went to voicemail (no text-back) | +3 | Direct proof they have the problem we solve |
| 50+ Google reviews | +2 | Higher review count = higher call volume |
| Response time > 30 minutes | +2 | Slow response = leads lost to competitors |
| Emergency / 24-hour services listed | +2 | Claims 24/7 but doesn't answer = strong angle |
| Owner-operator (small team) | +1 | Faster decision-maker, no red tape |
| Active Google Ads / LSA | +1 | Already paying for leads — missing calls = burning money |

**Score guide:** 10+ = Hot 🔥 | 7–9 = Warm ⚡ | Below 7 = Cool ❄️

### 🔹 Where to Find Prospects

| Source | What to Look For |
| --- | --- |
| **Google Maps** | Search "[industry] near Hennepin County" — sort by reviews |
| **Yelp** | Filter by "HVAC", "Plumbing", etc. in Minneapolis area |
| **Angi / HomeAdvisor** | Look for contractors with high demand but no chat widget |
| **Google Local Services Ads** | These businesses are *already paying for leads* — great targets |
| **Facebook Groups** | Local contractor groups — look for owners complaining about missed leads |
| **BBB Directory** | Established businesses that may have outdated phone systems |

---

### 🔹 After-Hours Test Script

When you call a prospect after hours, follow this exact process:

1. **Call their main number** at 6 PM or later (or on a weekend)
2. **Let it ring** — count the rings, note if it goes to voicemail
3. **Do NOT leave a voicemail** (simulates a real customer behavior — 85% don't)
4. **Start a timer** — how long until they respond in any way?
5. **Log everything** in the tracker above
