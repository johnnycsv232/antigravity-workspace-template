## **Problem Section**

**Headline:** The Hidden Drain on Your Profits: Every Missed Call Costs You.

**Body:**
As a busy contractor, you know the grind. Long hours, back-to-back jobs, and the constant struggle to keep up with inbound calls. But what if every unanswered call wasn't just a missed opportunity, but a direct hit to your bottom line?

- **40% of calls** to home service contractors go unanswered. That's nearly half your potential business [1].
- **85% of those callers** never call back. They don't leave a voicemail; they just move on [2].
- **80% call the next contractor** on their list. Your competitors are picking up your lost revenue [3].

This isn't just an inconvenience. It's **$26,000 to $126,000 in lost revenue** annually for the average contractor. Can you afford to keep leaving that much money on the table [4]?
