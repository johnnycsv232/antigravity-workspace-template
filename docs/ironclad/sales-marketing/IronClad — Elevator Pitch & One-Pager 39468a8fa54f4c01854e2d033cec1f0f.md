### 🔹 The 60-Second Pitch (For Meetings / Demos)

> **"Here's the problem: a homeowner's furnace dies at 8 PM. They Google 'HVAC near me' and call the top 3 results. Two go to voicemail. One texts back instantly — 'Hey, we got your call. What's going on? We can have someone out first thing tomorrow.' Who do you think gets the job?**

> **That's what IronClad does. We're an AI-powered missed-call texting service built specifically for home-service contractors in the Minneapolis area. When a call goes unanswered, our system texts the caller back in under 10 seconds with a personalized message. It qualifies the lead, captures their info, and notifies the business owner.**
