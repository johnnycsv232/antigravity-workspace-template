## **Phase 1: The Hook & Pain (2 min)**

**Agent:** "Hi [Prospect Name], thanks for taking 15 minutes. I know your time is valuable, so I'll get straight to it. We help HVAC, plumbing, and electrical contractors in Hennepin County stop losing money to missed calls."

**Agent:** "Quick question: On average, how many calls do you think your team misses in a week? After hours, during busy periods, or when techs are on a job?"

*Listen actively. Acknowledge their pain. If they say 'not many,' gently challenge with industry stats.*

**Agent:** "The reality is, for most contractors, it's far more than they realize. Industry data shows **40% of calls go unanswered**. And here's the kicker: **85% of those callers never call back**. They just call the next guy on Google. That's **$26,000 to $126,000 in lost revenue** annually for the average contractor. It's a silent killer of profits."

## **Phase 2: The IronClad Solution (5 min)**

**Agent:** "That's where IronClad comes in. We've built an AI-powered system specifically for contractors like you to capture every single missed call and turn it into a qualified, booked job. You literally wake up to booked appointments, not voicemails."

**Agent:** "Let me show you how it works. It's incredibly simple."

*Share screen. Show a quick, pre-recorded demo video or a live simulation of the AI text-back in action.*

**Agent:** "Imagine this: A customer calls your business at 6 PM on a Friday. Your office is closed. Instead of going to voicemail, our AI instantly detects that missed call. In **under 10 seconds**, it sends a personalized text message: 'Hey! We saw you called [Your Business Name]. What can we help with today?'"

**Agent:** "The AI then engages the customer, asks a few qualifying questions – 'Is this an emergency?', 'What's the issue?', 'What's your address?' – and if it's a qualified lead, it books them directly into your calendar. No human intervention needed until your tech shows up for the job."

## **Phase 3: Real Results & The Advantage (5 min)**

**Agent:** "This isn't theoretical. We've seen incredible results with our pilot clients. Take Standard Heating right here in Minneapolis. Before IronClad, they were losing 15-20 calls a week. Now, they capture every single one."

**Agent:** "Their average response time went from **8 hours to 9 seconds**. Their close rate on after-hours calls jumped from 12% to **41%**. That's an extra **$14,000 a month** in booked jobs for them. Imagine what that could do for your business."

**Agent:** "Our advantage is simple: **Speed and Focus**. We're 48x faster than the average response time. And we offer **zip code exclusivity**. Once you're on board, we won't work with your competitors in your service area. We protect your turf."

## **Phase 4: Call to Action & Next Steps (3 min)**

**Agent:** "So, [Prospect Name], the question isn't if you're missing calls, it's how much money you're losing. IronClad stops that bleed and turns it into profit."

**Agent:** "We have three simple plans, starting with our Pro tier at $249 setup and $197 a month. Most of our clients see an ROI within the first week."

**Agent:** "My recommendation: Let's get you set up on a 30-day pilot. We'll install IronClad, you'll see the leads come in, and if you're not thrilled with the results, we'll refund your setup fee. There's zero risk."

**Agent:** "How does that sound? Are you ready to turn those missed calls into booked jobs?"

*Address objections. Reiterate value. Push for commitment to pilot.*

**Agent:** "Great. I'll send over the agreement. Once that's signed, we can have you live and capturing leads within 24-48 hours."
