## IronClad — After-Hours Sales Script

<aside>
🎯

**Purpose:** Call prospects *after hours* so they experience their own missed-call problem firsthand. Then position IronClad as the fix.

---

### 🔹 Phase 1 — The Setup Call

Call the prospect's main business line **after 5 PM or on a weekend.** Let it ring to voicemail. Note:

- How many rings before voicemail?
- Is there a voicemail greeting?
- Do they text back? (Spoiler: they almost never do.)
- Time how long until you get *any* response.

---

### 🔹 Phase 2 — The Follow-Up Call (Next Business Day)

> **"Hey, this is [Your Name] with IronClad. I actually called your shop last night around [time] — it went to voicemail and I never heard back. No worries at all — that's actually why I'm calling."**
> 

*Pause — let them react.*

> **"I work with [HVAC / plumbing / electrical / roofing] companies here in Minneapolis, and we help make sure that when a customer calls after hours, they get a text back in under 10 seconds — automatically. So instead of losing that lead to the next contractor on Google, you've already started the conversation."**

### 🔹 Phase 3 — The Hook (Key Stats)

Use these data points conversationally:

| Stat | Source |
| --- | --- |
| **80%** of callers who hit voicemail call the next company | Industry research |
| **85%** of missed callers never call back | ServQuik data |
| **5-minute response** boosts conversions by up to **80%** | 99 Calls / MIT study |
| Businesses miss **~40%** of all inbound calls | Curious Thing AI |
| Average home-service job ticket: **$500–$1,500+** | Industry average |

> **"So if you're missing even 5 calls a week, and your average ticket is $800 — that's $4,000 a week walking to a competitor. We stop that."**
> 

---

### 🔹 Phase 4 — Qualifying Questions

1. **"How many calls would you say you miss per week — especially after hours or when you're on a job?"**
2. **"Do you have any kind of answering service or after-hours system right now?"**
3. **"What's your average job ticket value?"**
4. **"How are you currently following up with missed calls — manually, or…?"**

---

### 🔹 Phase 5 — The Pitch

> **"Here's how IronClad works:**
> 

> - **AI picks up the missed call instantly** and sends the caller a personalized text in under 10 seconds.
> 

> - **The text qualifies the lead** — asks what they need, captures their info, and lets them book or request a callback.
> 

> - **You get a notification** with the lead details so you can follow up when you're ready.
> 

> - **Setup takes 48 hours.** No contract. Pay-as-you-go. If it doesn't work, you turn it off."
> 

---

### 🔹 Phase 6 — The Close

> **"We can have this running for you by [day after tomorrow]. There's no contract — if you don't see results, you cancel anytime. Can I get you set up this week?"**
> 

**If they hesitate:**

> **"Tell you what — let me send you a quick response-time analysis. I'll show you exactly how long it takes your business to respond to a missed call versus your competitors. No obligation. Sound fair?"**
>

### 🔹 Objection Quick-Hits

| Objection | Response |
| --- | --- |
| "I already have a voicemail" | "Voicemail is great for messages — but 85% of callers don't leave one. They just call the next guy." |
| "I don't miss that many calls" | "Most owners are surprised. Can I run a quick analysis? It's free and takes 2 minutes to review." |
| "How much does it cost?" | "Setup fee plus a flat monthly — way less than one lost job. I'll send you the breakdown." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Totally fair. While you think, can I send you the response-time report so you have real data?" |
| "I don't trust AI" | "The AI just sends a text — it doesn't replace you. You still close the deal. It just makes sure the lead doesn't disappear." |
