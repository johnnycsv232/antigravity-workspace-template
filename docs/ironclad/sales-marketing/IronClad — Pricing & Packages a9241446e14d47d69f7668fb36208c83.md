### 🔹 Pricing Philosophy

- **Anchor to value, not cost.** One recovered job ($500–$1,500) should far exceed the monthly price.
- **No contracts.** This is a competitive advantage — lean into it.
- **Setup fee covers onboarding costs** and creates commitment from the client.
- **Keep it simple.** Contractors don't want to decode complex pricing.

### 🔹 Pricing Talk Track

> **"Our most popular plan is Pro at $197/month with a one-time $249 setup. That covers AI text-back on every missed call, lead qualification, SMS and email notifications, and a monthly report. No contract — cancel anytime."**
> 

> **"To put it in perspective — if your average job is $800 and we help you capture even one extra lead a month, that's a 4x return. Most of our clients see that in the first week."**

### 🔹 Discount & Incentive Strategies

| Strategy | Details |
| --- | --- |
| **Waive setup fee** | For referrals or first 10 pilot clients |
| **First month free** | If they sign up during the demo call |
| **Annual discount** | 2 months free if they prepay 12 months (optional — use sparingly) |
| **Referral credit** | $50 off next month for every referral that signs up |

---

### 🔹 When to Negotiate

- **Do** offer to waive setup for pilot clients — you need testimonials and case studies early
- **Do** offer a free month if they commit on the spot — urgency closes deals
- **Don't** discount the monthly rate below $97 — it devalues the product
- **Don't** offer free trials without a setup fee — it attracts non-serious leads
