### 🔹 Price Objections

**"How much does it cost?"**

> "Setup fee plus a flat monthly — typically less than the revenue from one missed job. If your average ticket is $800 and we capture even one extra lead a week, IronClad pays for itself many times over. Want me to send you the pricing breakdown?"
> 

**"That's too expensive."**

> "I hear you. But let me ask — how much does it cost you when a $1,200 job calls and gets your voicemail? If even 2–3 of those a month go to a competitor, that's $3,600 in lost revenue. IronClad costs a fraction of that."
> 

**"I can't afford another monthly expense right now."**

> "Totally fair — and that's exactly why there's no contract. You can try it for a month and see the numbers for yourself. If it doesn't pay for itself, you cancel. Zero risk."
>

### 🔹 Need / Relevance Objections

**"I don't miss that many calls."**

> "Most owners are surprised when they see the data. Industry research shows businesses miss about 40% of inbound calls on average. Can I run a free response-time analysis? It takes 2 minutes and gives you hard numbers."
> 

**"My voicemail works fine."**

> "Voicemail is great for people who leave messages — but 85% of callers don't. They just hang up and call the next company on Google. IronClad catches that 85%."
> 

**"I already have a receptionist / answering service."**

> "That's great during business hours. But what about nights, weekends, and holidays? IronClad covers the gaps when nobody's at the desk — and texts back in under 10 seconds."
> 

**"We're not that busy right now."**

> "That actually makes every single call more valuable, right? When volume is low, you can't afford to miss even one. IronClad makes sure you don't."
>

### 🔹 Trust / Tech Objections

**"I don't trust AI."**

> "Totally understand. IronClad's AI doesn't replace you — it just sends a text. You still talk to the customer, you still close the deal. The AI just makes sure the lead doesn't disappear before you get the chance."
> 

**"What if the AI says something wrong?"**

> "You approve the text message template during setup. The AI sends exactly what you want it to say — your business name, your tone, your call-to-action. Nothing goes out that you haven't seen first."
> 

**"Is my data secure?"**

> "Yes — we don't store call recordings or sensitive customer data. The system captures the caller's number, sends your approved text, and logs the lead. That's it."
>

### 🔹 Timing / Decision Objections

**"I need to think about it."**

> "Absolutely. While you think it over, can I send you a free response-time analysis? That way you'll have real data to help you decide — no strings attached."
> 

**"Can you call me back next month?"**

> "Of course. In the meantime — every missed call between now and then is a potential lost job. If you want to stop that sooner, just reply to my email and we'll have you live in 48 hours."
> 

**"I need to talk to my partner / spouse."**

> "Makes total sense. Want me to send over a quick one-pager you can share? It covers exactly what IronClad does, what it costs, and the ROI."
>

### 🔹 Competitor Objections

**"I've heard of other services like this."**

> "There are a few out there. What sets IronClad apart is speed — under 10 seconds — and the fact that we specialize in home-service businesses. We're not a generic tool. We built this for HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing companies specifically."
> 

**"My CRM already has text features."**

> "CRMs are great for follow-up, but they usually require manual triggers or workflows. IronClad is fully automatic — the second a call is missed, the text goes out. No clicks, no delays, no human needed."
