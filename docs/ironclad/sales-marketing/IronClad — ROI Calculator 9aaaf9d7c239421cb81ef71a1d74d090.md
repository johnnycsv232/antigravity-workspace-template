### 🔹 How to Use This With Prospects

1. **Ask:** "How many calls do you think you miss per week?" (They'll guess low — that's fine.)
2. **Ask:** "What's your average job ticket?"
3. **Do the math on the spot:** Missed calls × 4 weeks × 30% × ticket = monthly revenue at risk
4. **Compare:** "IronClad costs [monthly price]. So even if we capture one extra job a month, you're way ahead."
5. **Anchor:** Always compare the monthly cost to **one lost job** — not to their total expenses.

### 🔹 Talk Track Example

> **"Let's say you miss 5 calls a week — that's pretty conservative for a busy shop. Your average ticket is $800. With a 30% close rate on recovered leads, that's roughly $4,800 a month in revenue you're leaving on the table. IronClad costs a fraction of one of those jobs. The math is pretty simple."**
