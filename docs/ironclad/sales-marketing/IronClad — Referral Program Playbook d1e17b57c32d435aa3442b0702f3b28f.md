### 🔹 When to Ask for Referrals

**The 4 natural ask points:**

1. **Day 7 check-in** — If they're seeing leads come in and they're happy
    
    > *"Glad it's working! Do you know any other contractors who could use this? If they sign up, your next month is $50 off."*
    > 
2. **Day 30 review** — After showing them their monthly ROI report
    
    > *"You've recovered $[X] this month. Know anyone else who's probably missing calls like you were? Referrals get a free setup."*
    > 
3. **After a great testimonial or review** — They're already in a positive mindset
    
    > *"Thanks for the kind words! If you know anyone in the trades who'd benefit, I'd love an intro — and you'll get $50 off your next bill."*
    > 
4. **Quarterly touchpoint** — For long-term clients
    
    > *"Hey [Name], just checking in. Everything running smooth? By the way — our referral program is still active if you know anyone."*
    >

### 🔹 Referral Outreach Templates

**Text to send the referrer (for them to forward):**

> 

**Email intro request:**

> *"If you're comfortable making an intro, I'll take it from there. Just CC me on an email to them and I'll follow up. No pressure on your end."*
