### 🔹 The Demo Flow

**Step 1 — Set the Scene**

> **"Alright [Name], I want to show you something real quick. I'm going to pretend I'm a homeowner whose [furnace just died / pipe just burst / power went out]. I'm going to call your main business number right now — just like a real customer would. Let's see what happens."**
> 

**Step 2 — Make the Call (on speakerphone)**

- Call their main number
- Let it ring to voicemail (or wherever it goes)
- **Do NOT leave a voicemail** — say: *"Just like 85% of real callers, I'm not going to leave a message."*
- Start the stopwatch

**Step 3 — Wait and Narrate**

> **"Okay, so I just called. The clock is running. Let's see how long it takes to get any kind of response…"**
> 

*Wait 30 seconds.* 

> **"30 seconds — a real customer has already Googled your competitor."**
> 

*Wait 60 seconds.* 

> **"One minute — statistically, that caller is now on the phone with someone else."**
> 

*Wait 2 minutes (or until they get the point).* 

> **"Two minutes. No text, no callback, no acknowledgment. That lead is gone."**
> 

**Step 4 — Show the IronClad Difference**

> **"Now here's what happens with IronClad. The second that call goes unanswered, our AI sends a text — in under 10 seconds. It says something like:**
> 

> 
> 

> *'Hey! This is [Business Name]. Sorry we missed your call. What can we help you with? Reply here and we'll get back to you ASAP.'*
> 

> 
> 

> **That caller is now texting with your business instead of calling your competitor. We capture their name, what they need, and their contact info — and you get a notification instantly."**
> 

**Step 5 — The Close**

> **"So here's the question: how many of those calls are you missing every week? Even if it's just 3 or 4 — at your average ticket, that's thousands in revenue. IronClad catches every single one.**
> 

> 
> 

> **We can have this live for you in 48 hours. No contract. Want to get started?"**

### 🔹 If They Push Back

| Pushback | Response |
| --- | --- |
| "That was after hours, though" | "Exactly — and that's when most emergency calls happen. Evenings and weekends are peak for [HVAC/plumbing]." |
| "We don't get that many calls" | "Let's find out. I'll run a free response-time analysis — real data, no guessing." |
| "I'll just check my voicemail more" | "The issue isn't checking voicemail — it's that 85% of callers don't leave one. They just hang up." |
