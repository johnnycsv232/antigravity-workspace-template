# IronClad — Response-Time Analysis Framework

Author: GETTUPP ENT 
Description: The document outlines the "Response-Time Analysis Framework" for assessing how quickly a business responds to missed calls. It details a standardized method for conducting an analysis, including steps for making test calls, calculating average response times, comparing results to industry benchmarks, and estimating potential revenue loss from missed calls. A report template is provided to communicate findings to prospects, emphasizing the importance of timely responses and the potential revenue at risk. The framework is presented as a valuable sales tool to convert cold prospects into warm leads by highlighting specific data related to their business.

### 🔹 What Is a Response-Time Analysis?

A short report you create for a prospect that shows:

- How long it takes their business to respond to a missed call
- How that compares to industry benchmarks
- How much revenue they're likely losing

**This is your #1 sales weapon.** It turns a cold prospect into a warm one because the data is about *their* business.

### 🔹 How to Run the Analysis

**Step 1 — Call the prospect after hours (3 times over 1 week)**

| **Call #** | **Day / Time** | **Result** | **Response Time** | **Response Type** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | e.g. Mon 6:30 PM | Voicemail, no callback | Never | None |
| 2 | e.g. Wed 7:15 PM | Voicemail, callback next day | 14 hours | Phone call |
| 3 | e.g. Sat 10:00 AM | No answer, no response | Never | None |

**Step 2 — Calculate their average response time**

- If they never responded: *"Your average response time to after-hours calls is: No response"*
- If they responded once out of 3: *"You responded to 33% of test calls with an average delay of 14 hours"*

**Step 3 — Compare to benchmarks**

| **Response Time** | **Lead Outcome** |
| --- | --- |
| **Under 1 minute** | Best-in-class — lead is highly likely to convert |
| **1–5 minutes** | Good — 80% higher conversion vs. 30+ minutes |
| **5–30 minutes** | Risky — lead is already shopping competitors |
| **30+ minutes or never** | Lead is lost — 80% have already called someone else |

**Step 4 — Estimate revenue impact**

Use the ROI Calculator:

> Missed calls/week × 4 × close rate (30%) × avg ticket = **monthly revenue at risk**

**Response-Time Analysis for [Business Name]**

*Prepared by IronClad — [Date]*

**Summary:**

We tested your business's response to missed calls on 3 separate occasions over the past week. Here's what we found:

- **Calls made:** 3 (after hours / weekends)
- **Responses received:** [0 / 1 / 2 / 3]
- **Average response time:** [Never / X hours]
- **Industry benchmark:** Under 5 minutes for best conversion rates

**What this means:**

Based on your response time, an estimated **[X]%** of your after-hours callers are likely calling a competitor before they hear back from you. At an average ticket of $[X] and an estimated [X] missed calls per week, this translates to approximately **$[X] per month in at-risk revenue.**

**The fix:**

IronClad texts every missed caller back in under 10 seconds — automatically. No contracts. 48-hour setup. One recovered job pays for months of service.
