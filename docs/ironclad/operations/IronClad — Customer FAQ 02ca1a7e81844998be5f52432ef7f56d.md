**What is IronClad?**

> IronClad is an AI-powered missed-call texting service for home-service businesses. When you miss a call, our system automatically texts the caller back in under 10 seconds with a personalized message — so you never lose a lead to a competitor.
> 

**Who is IronClad for?**

> We specialize in HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing companies in the Minneapolis / Hennepin County area. If your business depends on inbound phone calls, IronClad is built for you.

### 🔹 How It Works

**What happens when I miss a call?**

> Within 10 seconds, IronClad sends the caller a personalized text message from your business. The text acknowledges their call, asks what they need, and captures their contact info.
> 

**Do I need to change my phone number?**

> No. We set up call forwarding on your existing number. Your customers still call the same number they always have.
> 

**Does it work after hours?**

> Yes — IronClad works 24/7/365. Nights, weekends, holidays. That's when most calls get missed, and when your competitors are asleep.
> 

**What does the text message say?**

> You choose! During setup, we customize the message to match your brand, tone, and services. You approve everything before it goes live.
> 

**Can the AI book appointments?**

> The AI captures the lead's info and what they need. You can then follow up to book. Advanced booking features are on our roadmap.
>

### 🔹 Setup & Onboarding

**How long does setup take?**

> 48 hours or less. We collect your business info on Day 1, configure and test everything, and you're live on Day 2.
> 

**What do you need from me to get started?**

> Just your business name, phone number, hours of operation, list of services, and your preferred text message tone. We handle the rest.
> 

**Is there any equipment I need to install?**

> None. IronClad is 100% cloud-based. It works with your existing phone system.
>

### 🔹 Pricing & Terms

**How much does it cost?**

> There's a one-time setup fee plus a flat monthly rate. Contact us for current pricing — it's typically less than the revenue from one missed job.
> 

**Is there a contract?**

> No. IronClad is pay-as-you-go. Cancel anytime — no penalties, no fine print.
> 

**Is there a free trial?**

> We offer a free response-time analysis so you can see exactly how many leads you're missing before you commit. Ask us about current promotions.
>

### 🔹 Privacy & Security

**Is my data secure?**

> Yes. We don't store call recordings or sensitive customer data. The system captures the caller's number, sends your approved text, and logs the lead.
> 

**Who can see my leads?**

> Only you. Lead data is accessible through your IronClad dashboard and notifications.
>

### 🔹 Results & Support

**How will I know it's working?**

> You'll receive a notification for every lead captured. Plus, we send a weekly and monthly report showing leads captured, response times, and estimated revenue recovered.
> 

**What if I want to change my text message?**

> Just let us know — we can update your message anytime. Most clients tweak their message once after the first week based on feedback.
> 

**What kind of support do you offer?**

> Direct support via text, email, or phone. We also do a check-in call at Day 7 and monthly reviews to make sure everything is running smoothly.
