## 🎤 Elevator Pitches

<aside>
⚡

**10-Second Pitch**
*"IronClad helps contractors capture every missed call. Our AI texts leads back in under 10 seconds — before they call the next guy."*

</aside>

<aside>
🎯

**30-Second Pitch**
*"I work with HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing companies in Minneapolis. Most don't realize they're missing 40% of inbound calls — and 85% never call back. IronClad texts missed callers in under 10 seconds. No contracts. 48-hour setup. Pays for itself after one job."*

</aside>

### 🎬 60-Second Pitch (Meetings & Demos)

> *"Here's the problem: a homeowner's furnace dies at 8 PM. They Google 'HVAC near me' and call the top 3 results. Two go to voicemail. One texts back instantly — 'Hey, we got your call. What's going on?' Who gets the job?*

*That's IronClad. AI-powered missed-call texting for home-service contractors in Minneapolis. Under 10 seconds. Qualifies the lead. Notifies you instantly.*

*48-hour setup. No contract. Most shops lose $4,000–$8,000/month to missed calls. IronClad costs less than one lost job. Want me to show you how it works?"*

## 🛡️ Objection Quick-Reference

| **Objection** | **Response** |
| --- | --- |
| "Too expensive" | "How much does a $1,200 job cost when the caller goes to voicemail and calls the next guy? IronClad costs a fraction of one lost job." |
| "I don't miss many calls" | "Most owners are surprised. Industry data shows ~40% of calls go unanswered. Can I run a free 2-minute response-time analysis?" |
| "My voicemail works fine" | "85% of callers don't leave a voicemail — they just call the next company. IronClad catches that 85%." |
| "I already have an answering service" | "Great for business hours. But what about nights, weekends, holidays? IronClad covers the gaps in under 10 seconds." |
| "I don't trust AI" | "The AI just sends a text you've pre-approved — it doesn't replace you. You still close the deal." |
| "I need to think about it" | "Absolutely. Let me send a free response-time analysis so you have real data to help decide — no strings attached." |
| "I use GoHighLevel / a CRM" | "IronClad isn't a CRM — it's a fast-response layer that plugs into what you already have. No overlap." |
| "I saw something like this" | "Most tools are generic. IronClad was built for contractors in Minneapolis — we know your market, your customers, and your urgency." |

<aside>
🎯

**Golden Rule:** Never argue. **Acknowledge → Reframe → Offer proof.** The free response-time analysis is your best closer.
