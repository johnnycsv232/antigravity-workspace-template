I'll read both the internet-skill-finder and skill-creator skills to understand what they offer, then help you with your request.
Max
I see you've invoked both /internet-skill-finder and /skill-creator. Before I proceed, let me clarify what I'll do:
Internet Skill Finder — I'll search the 7 verified GitHub repositories for existing Agent Skills that could be useful for the IronClad project (e.g., skills related to web scraping, CRM automation, email campaigns, payment processing, n8n workflows, etc.)
Skill Creator — If there are gaps where no existing skill covers IronClad's needs, I can create custom skills.
Let me start by searching for skills relevant to IronClad's core domains. Do you have specific skill areas you'd like me to prioritize, or should I search broadly across IronClad's key needs (missed-call capture, HVAC/contractor outreach, lead generation, n8n automation, Stripe billing, etc.)?

Existing skills that match IronClad's needs: 12 skills found (Stripe, HubSpot, Mailchimp, Vercel, Slack, Invoice Organizer, Postgres, Google Analytics, Webapp Testing, Systematic Debugging, OWASP Security, Varlock)
Critical gaps with NO existing skill: 8 major gaps identified — the IronClad-specific workflows (Stitch Loop, Compatibility Validator, Conversion Psychology Engine, Twilio integration, n8n workflows, Supabase full-stack, Prospect Builder, and Brand/SSOT Enforcer).
I'll now design and create custom skills to fill these gaps. I'll focus on the most impactful ones that encode IronClad's proprietary processes from your system prompt and orchestration doc.
Reviewed workflow and output pattern references; these guide designing complex, conditional, and consistent skills aligned with IronClad's proprietary workflows for impactful custom development.

I successfully initialized five IronClad skills and cleaned up example files. Next, I will review and finalize the SKILL.md file for the ironclad-stitch-loop to ensure clear documentation and proper structure.

Finished cleaning existing SKILL.md files, preparing to write new, clearer documentation for each IronClad skill. Will now proceed with finalizing the documentation structure.

I've completed initial skill documentation files and templates. Next, I will review relevant GitHub repositories to find and assess skills for IronClad's full-stack requirements.

I documented skills for several IronClad modules and cleaned up unnecessary directories, progressing towards verifying and integrating relevant GitHub-repo skills for full-stack development.

I verified the directory structure of five custom skills, confirming they include key documentation files. Next, I'll review their content for integration readiness.

I validated all five custom skills, fixing the description in the compatibility-validator to remove angle brackets, and re-validated it successfully. Will proceed with next steps.

IronClad AI Agent Skill Analysis & Custom Build Report
Date: February 11, 2026
Author: Manus AI
1. Introduction
Per your request to leverage /internet-skill-finder and /skill-creator, I have completed a comprehensive analysis of the Agent Skill ecosystem in the context of the IronClad project. This report details the process, findings, and the custom skills built to create a specialized AI Founder Agent tailored to IronClad's unique operational methodologies.
The process followed these steps:
Context Ingestion: Analyzed the Master System Prompt and Build Orchestration documents to understand IronClad's specific needs, mandated tech stack, and proprietary workflows.
Broad Skill Search: Queried 7 verified GitHub skill repositories using over 20 keywords relevant to IronClad's domains (e.g., n8n, stripe, twilio, nextjs, supabase, hubspot, scraping).
Gap Analysis: Compared the functionality of existing public skills against the strict requirements of the IronClad project, identifying critical gaps where no off-the-shelf skill would suffice.
Custom Skill Creation: Designed, built, and validated 5 new, custom Agent Skills that encode IronClad's core proprietary processes, transforming the general-purpose agent into a specialized AI co-founder.
2. Existing Skills Analysis
The search yielded several potentially useful skills, primarily from the ComposioHQ/awesome-claude-skills repository. However, a significant limitation is that most of these skills rely on an intermediary MCP server (Rube), which may not align with IronClad's goal of direct API control and minimal dependencies.
Below is a summary of the most relevant public skills and their applicability to IronClad.

**This is the complete build orchestration for IronClad.** Copy the sections below into the Manus project instructions AFTER the main system prompt. This gives the agent the tech stack direction, Twilio config, prompt chain for backend build, landing page copy, SVG specs, and scaffold deliverables.

</aside>

<aside>
🚨

**CRITICAL: NO HARDCODED VERSIONS. NO OVER-ENGINEERING.**
This orchestration doc uses framework/library NAMES but does NOT pin versions. The agent MUST research the current stable release of every dependency at build time via official docs. Do NOT assume "Next.js 14" or any other version — check [nextjs.org/docs](http://nextjs.org/docs), [supabase.com/docs](http://supabase.com/docs), [prisma.io/docs](http://prisma.io/docs), etc. for the latest stable before writing a single line of code. Every integration pair must be verified compatible via official guides or GitHub issues search. Edge cases must be researched. The founder reviews the compatibility report BEFORE any code is written.

## 🧩 Google Stitch MCP → Skill → API Design Loop

```jsx
=== GOOGLE STITCH MCP → SKILL → API LOOP (FRONTEND DESIGN ENGINE) ===

The IronClad frontend MUST be designed using the Google Stitch MCP pipeline.
Stitch is Google's AI-powered UI generation engine exposed via the Model Context Protocol.
It generates production-ready screens from prompts — not mockups, not wireframes, REAL UI.

This is NOT optional. Every page, component, and screen goes through this loop.

--- HOW THE LOOP WORKS ---

STEP 1: ENHANCE PROMPT (Skill: enhance-prompt)
  Before generating ANY screen, run your prompt through the enhance-prompt skill.
  This transforms vague UI ideas into polished, Stitch-optimized prompts.
  It adds UI/UX keywords, injects design system context, and structures output
  for better generation results.
  INPUT: rough description (e.g. "IronClad pricing page with 3 tiers")
  OUTPUT: detailed, keyword-rich, design-system-aware generation prompt

STEP 2: GENERATE SCREENS (Stitch MCP Server)
  Feed the enhanced prompt to the Stitch MCP server.
  MCP Server URL: https://stitch.googleapis.com/mcp
  Auth: X-Goog-Api-Key header with your GCP API key
  Stitch generates complete, pixel-perfect UI screens.
  It understands: layout, typography, color systems, spacing, responsive breakpoints,
  component hierarchy, interaction patterns, and accessibility.

STEP 3: STITCH-LOOP (Skill: stitch-loop)
  For multi-page generation, use the stitch-loop skill.
  It generates a COMPLETE multi-page website from a single prompt.
  Automated file organization and validation included.
  Use this for the full IronClad marketing site:
    → Homepage (hero, stats, how it works, features, pricing, ROI calc, FAQ, CTA)
    → Pricing page (detailed comparison)
    → About page (founder story, mission)
    → Dashboard shell (lead overview, stats cards)
    → Onboarding flow screens

STEP 4: VALIDATE & ITERATE
  After generation, run the Tech Stack Compatibility Check (below).
  If any component conflicts with the mandated stack → regenerate with constraints.
  If the design doesn't match brand specs → re-enhance prompt with brand tokens.
  Loop until: generated output + mandated stack + brand identity = perfect alignment.

--- THE LOOP ---
  ENHANCE → GENERATE → VALIDATE → (if fail) → RE-ENHANCE → REGENERATE → RE-VALIDATE
  Keep looping until ALL checks pass. Do NOT ship a screen that fails validation.

STITCH MCP CONFIGURATION:
  Add to your MCP client settings (Cursor, Claude Code, Antigravity, Gemini CLI):
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "stitch": {
        "serverUrl": "https://stitch.googleapis.com/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "X-Goog-Api-Key": "YOUR-GCP-API-KEY"
        }
      }
    }
  }

STITCH SETUP:
  1. Install Google Cloud CLI (gcloud)
  2. Authenticate: gcloud auth application-default login
  3. Select GCP project with Stitch API enabled
  4. Configure IAM permissions for Stitch
  5. Generate API key
  6. Add MCP config to your coding agent
  CLI helper: npx stitch-mcp (guides you through all steps)

STITCH PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR IRONCLAD:
  Every Stitch prompt MUST include:
  → Brand tokens: Navy #1B2A4A, Gold #D4A843, White #FFFFFF, Gray #F5F5F5
  → Font: Inter 700 headings, system-ui 400/500 body
  → Component lib: shadcn/ui (specify: use shadcn/ui Button, Card, etc.)
  → Framework: Next.js (latest stable App Router) + Tailwind CSS
  → Tone: "professional, trustworthy, bold, contractor-friendly"
  → Shield motif: include shield iconography in hero and CTA sections
  → Mobile-first: always specify responsive behavior
  Example enhanced prompt:
  "Generate a SaaS landing page hero section for IronClad, a missed-call capture
  service for home-service contractors. Navy (#1B2A4A) background with gold (#D4A843)
  accent CTA buttons. Inter font, bold headline 'Stop Losing Jobs to Voicemail'.
  Subtext in white. Two CTAs: primary gold button 'Start Capturing Leads', secondary
  outline white button 'Free Response-Time Analysis'. Trust badge below: 'No contracts.
  48-hour setup. Cancel anytime.' Phone mockup on right showing SMS conversation.
  Use shadcn/ui Button and Card components. Tailwind CSS utility classes. Responsive:
  stack vertically on mobile. Framer Motion fade-in animation on scroll."
```

## 🔄 Stitch Loop Checklist (Mandatory)

<aside>
🔄

**STITCH LOOP — MANDATORY FOR ALL UI GENERATION. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
Every page, component, and screen goes through this loop. "Prompt roulette" is banned.

</aside>

| **Step** | **Action** | **Tool / Skill** | **Output** | **Status** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Enhance prompt** — turn rough UI idea into Stitch-ready spec with brand tokens, component lib, responsive rules | `enhance-prompt` skill | Stitch-optimized prompt | ⬜ |
| 2 | **Stitch generate** — feed enhanced prompt to MCP server, receive production-ready screen | Stitch MCP Server | Generated UI code | ⬜ |
| 3 | **Validation Engine** — run 12-point pass/fail matrix (framework, styling, components, TS, deploy, DB, auth, payments, voice, monitoring, Lighthouse, bundle) | Validation Engine (below) | 12/12 PASS or fail list | ⬜ |
| 4 | **If fail →** re-enhance prompt with failure reasons → regenerate → re-validate. Loop until 12/12 PASS. | Loop steps 1–3 | Ship-ready component | ⬜ |

**Rule:** If a component ships without completing this loop, it is a build defect. Roll back and re-run.

## 🧠 Marketing Psychology & Offer Optimization Engine

```jsx
=== MARKETING PSYCHOLOGY & OFFER OPTIMIZATION ENGINE ===
Before launching ANY landing page, pricing page, ad, email, or sales asset,
the agent MUST study and apply these marketing psychology principles.
The goal: make the IronClad offer so compelling that saying "no" feels irrational.
--- RESEARCH MANDATE ---
Before designing ANY conversion-focused page or copy:
  1. Search for skills: "Marketing Psychology" / "Conversion Optimization" / "CRO"
  2. Study top SaaS landing pages in the contractor/home-service space
  3. Analyze what GoHighLevel, ServiceTitan, Jobber, Housecall Pro do on their pages
  4. Research: What makes contractors specifically click, trust, and buy?
  5. Document findings BEFORE writing a single line of copy or UI
--- THE 12 PSYCHOLOGY PRINCIPLES (apply to every customer-facing asset) ---
1. LOSS AVERSION (Kahneman & Tversky)
   People feel losses 2x more than equivalent gains.
   APPLICATION: Frame everything as what they're LOSING, not what they'll gain.
   → "You're losing $8,400/month to voicemail" > "You could earn $8,400 more"
   → ROI Calculator shows money LEAVING, not money arriving
   → Headline: "Stop Losing Jobs" not "Start Getting Jobs"
   → Use red/negative colors for the "at risk" numbers
2. SOCIAL PROOF (Cialdini)
   People follow what others like them are doing.
   APPLICATION:
   → "47 Minneapolis contractors already use IronClad" (even if aspirational)
   → Testimonials from SAME industry: "As an HVAC shop owner..."
   → Google review count badges: "Trusted by shops with 50+ reviews"
   → Logo bar of contractor types served (even if using icons, not real logos)
   → "Most popular" badge on Pro plan = social proof on pricing
3. URGENCY & SCARCITY (Cialdini)
   Limited availability increases perceived value.
   APPLICATION (ethical, real urgency only):
   → "We onboard 5 new contractors per month in Minneapolis" (capacity limit)
   → "48-hour setup" = speed creates urgency to start NOW
   → "Your competitors are already answering" = competitive urgency
   → "Every day without IronClad = X missed leads" (calculated daily loss)
   → DO NOT use fake countdown timers or false scarcity. Contractors see through BS.
4. ANCHORING (Tversky & Kahneman)
   First number sets the reference point for all judgments.
   APPLICATION:
   → Show the "Revenue at Risk" ($27,000/mo) BEFORE showing the price ($197/mo)
   → Pricing page: show Premium ($347) first, then Pro ($197) feels cheap
   → ROI Calculator: default slider to 8 missed calls (higher anchor)
   → "Average job value: $800" anchors high in the calculator
   → Setup fee anchored against: "One captured lead pays for 6 months"
5. THE DECOY EFFECT (Ariely)
   A third option makes the target option look like the best deal.
   APPLICATION:
   → Starter ($97) = stripped down (the decoy that makes Pro look worth it)
   → Pro ($197) = the target (everything a contractor needs, "Most Popular")
   → Premium ($347) = aspirational (makes Pro feel affordable by comparison)
   → Feature gap between Starter and Pro must be LARGE
   → Feature gap between Pro and Premium should be SMALLER
   → This funnels 70%+ of buyers to Pro. Proven SaaS pricing psychology.
6. RECIPROCITY (Cialdini)
   Give value first, people feel obligated to return the favor.
   APPLICATION:
   → "Free Response-Time Analysis" = the lead magnet. Give REAL value first.
   → The analysis shows them their own missed-call data (eye-opening)
   → After seeing the data, they feel the pain AND feel grateful for the insight
   → Free analysis → Follow-up call → Demo → Close. Classic reciprocity funnel.
   → Blog content, guides, and tools = all reciprocity plays
7. AUTHORITY (Cialdini)
   People trust experts and data.
   APPLICATION:
   → Cite real statistics: "40% of calls missed" (industry data)
   → "Based on analysis of 10,000+ contractor calls" (when we have the data)
   → Use specific numbers: "< 10 seconds" not "really fast"
   → "Minneapolis market specialist" = local authority positioning
   → Case studies with REAL numbers, not vague praise
8. COMMITMENT & CONSISTENCY (Cialdini)
   Small yes leads to bigger yes.
   APPLICATION:
   → Free analysis (small yes) → Trial (medium yes) → Paid plan (big yes)
   → "No contract" removes the big scary commitment
   → "48-hour setup" = low commitment to start
   → ROI Calculator = interactive micro-commitment (they invested time)
   → Email capture → Nurture → Demo → each step is a small commitment
9. THE ENDOWMENT EFFECT (Thaler)
   People overvalue what they already have.
   APPLICATION:
   → Free trial or pilot: once they SEE leads coming in, they can't give it up
   → "Try it for 30 days" = they'll feel ownership of captured leads
   → Monthly ROI report: "You captured 23 leads worth $18,400 this month"
   → Cancellation becomes painful because they'd lose THEIR leads
10. COGNITIVE EASE (Kahneman)
    Simple = trustworthy. Complex = suspicious.
    APPLICATION:
    → 3-step "How It Works" (never more than 3 steps)
    → Pricing: 3 plans, clear names, no hidden fees
    → "No phone system change" = reduces complexity fear
    → "You just get a text" = the simplest possible value delivery
    → Landing page: one clear CTA per section. Never overwhelm.
    → Contractor-friendly language. No jargon. No tech speak.
11. THE PEAK-END RULE (Kahneman)
    People judge experiences by the peak moment and the ending.
    APPLICATION:
    → Onboarding peak: first REAL lead captured = "holy shit" moment
    → Day 7 check-in: show the before vs. after report (peak impact)
    → Monthly ROI report: end each month on a high note
    → Landing page: end with the strongest CTA + most compelling stat
    → The final CTA: "Your Competitors Are Answering. Are You?" = end on urgency
12. CONTRAST PRINCIPLE (Cialdini)
    Show the painful alternative to make yours look better.
    APPLICATION:
    → "Without IronClad" vs "With IronClad" comparison
    → Show: voicemail (85% never call back) vs IronClad (< 10 sec text)
    → Competitor comparison: GoHighLevel ($297/mo + complexity) vs IronClad ($197/mo + simplicity)
    → "Hiring a receptionist: $2,500/mo" vs "IronClad: $197/mo"
    → Before/after split-screen on the landing page
--- OFFER PERFECTION CHECKLIST ---
Before shipping ANY offer (landing page, ad, email, pitch), verify:
  ✅ Loss aversion: Does it frame what they're LOSING?
  ✅ Social proof: Are there testimonials, numbers, or trust signals?
  ✅ Urgency: Is there a real, ethical reason to act NOW?
  ✅ Anchoring: Is a big number shown BEFORE the price?
  ✅ Decoy: Does the pricing structure funnel to Pro?
  ✅ Reciprocity: Are we giving value BEFORE asking for money?
  ✅ Authority: Are we citing data, specifics, and expertise?
  ✅ Commitment ladder: Is the ask small enough for the funnel stage?
  ✅ Endowment: Will they feel ownership once they start?
  ✅ Cognitive ease: Is it simple enough for a busy contractor at 7 PM?
  ✅ Peak-end: Does it end with the strongest possible impression?
  ✅ Contrast: Is the alternative (doing nothing) shown as painful?
  ALL 12 must be present. If any are missing → revise before shipping.
--- OFFER OPTIMIZATION LOOP ---
For every customer-facing asset, run this loop:
  1. STUDY: Research top-performing pages in home-service SaaS
  2. DRAFT: Write copy/design with all 12 principles embedded
  3. SCORE: Rate each principle 1-5 for how strongly it's applied
  4. OPTIMIZE: Strengthen any principle scoring below 3
  5. A/B TEST: Use PostHog feature flags to test variants
  6. MEASURE: Track conversion rates per variant
  7. ITERATE: Keep the winner, test the next weakest principle
  Target: 12/12 principles at 4+ strength = ship-ready offer
--- CONTRACTOR-SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGY ---
Contractors are NOT typical SaaS buyers. Know their psychology:
  → They are SKEPTICAL of tech. Prove it works, don't explain how.
  → They respect RESULTS, not features. Lead with ROI, not AI.
  → They are TIME-POOR. Get to the point in 5 seconds or lose them.
  → They trust PEERS, not marketers. Testimonials > ad copy.
  → They fear COMPLEXITY. "You don't touch anything" = magic words.
  → They make EMOTIONAL decisions justified with LOGIC. Hit the pain first.
  → They respond to SPECIFIC NUMBERS. "$8,400/mo" not "thousands."
  → They browse on MOBILE while on job sites. Mobile-first is mandatory.
  → They buy in the EVENING after work. Target 6-9 PM for ads/emails.
  → They talk to OTHER CONTRACTORS. Referral program = growth engine.
```

## 📞 Twilio Setup & Configuration

```jsx
=== TWILIO SETUP & CONFIGURATION ===

ACCOUNT SETUP:
1. Create Twilio account (free trial = $15 credit, enough to test)
2. Buy a local Minneapolis +1(612) phone number (~$1.00/mo)
3. Enable Programmable Voice + Programmable Messaging on the number
4. Set Voice webhook: POST https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/twilio/voice
5. Set SMS webhook: POST https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/twilio/sms
6. Set Status Callback: POST https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL/api/twilio/status

MISSED CALL DETECTION FLOW:
  Incoming call → Twilio webhook hits /api/twilio/voice
  → TwiML response: <Dial timeout="20">CONTRACTOR_PHONE</Dial>
  → If contractor answers: done, no action needed
  → If no answer (CallStatus: "no-answer" | "busy" | "failed"):
    → Status callback hits /api/twilio/status
    → API calls /api/twilio/sms to send instant text-back
    → OpenAI generates personalized greeting text
    → Twilio sends SMS to caller in <10 seconds
    → Lead record created in Supabase (leads table)
    → Contractor notified via SMS + Email + Slack
    → AI begins qualification conversation via SMS

TWILIO WEBHOOK PAYLOAD (what your API receives on voice):
  CallSid, AccountSid, From, To, CallStatus, Direction, ApiVersion, Timestamp
  → Trigger on: CallStatus === "no-answer" || "busy" || "failed" || "canceled"

COST ESTIMATE AT SCALE:
  Phone number: $1.00/mo per contractor
  Inbound voice: $0.0085/min
  Outbound SMS: $0.0079/segment (160 chars)
  Inbound SMS: $0.0075/segment
  Per contractor (avg 20 missed calls/mo): ~$0.50/mo Twilio cost
  At 50 clients: ~$75/mo total Twilio spend vs $9,850/mo revenue = 99.2% margin
  UNIT ECONOMICS: Massive margin. Twilio cost is negligible.
```

### Prompt 1: Project Scaffold

```jsx
"STEP 0 — RESEARCH BEFORE SCAFFOLDING:
  Before running ANY install commands, verify current stable versions:
  → nextjs.org/docs — what is the latest stable App Router release?
  → ui.shadcn.com — what is the current init command? (it may have changed)
  → prisma.io/docs — any breaking changes in the latest version?
  → supabase.com/docs — current @supabase/ssr version and setup?
  → docs.sentry.io — current @sentry/nextjs wizard command?
  → Check npm for latest stable: twilio, stripe, posthog-js, framer-motion
  → Search GitHub Issues for conflicts between these at current versions
  → Deliver VERSION REPORT to founder. Get approval before proceeding.

STEP 1 — Create Next.js project (latest stable App Router):
  npx create-next-app@latest ironclad --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir

Install all dependencies:
  npm install @supabase/supabase-js @supabase/ssr prisma @prisma/client
  npm install twilio stripe @stripe/stripe-js
  npm install @sentry/nextjs posthog-js
  npm install lucide-react framer-motion
  npm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod
  npx shadcn-ui@latest init (choose: New York style, Slate base, CSS variables: yes)

### Prompt 3: Twilio Voice Webhook (Core Product)

```jsx
"Build src/app/api/twilio/voice/route.ts:
  - Accept POST from Twilio with incoming call data
  - Validate Twilio request signature (security)
  - Look up contractor by the Twilio number (req.body.To)
  - If contractor found and active:
    → Return TwiML: <Response><Dial timeout='20' action='/api/twilio/status'
      method='POST'>CONTRACTOR_PHONE</Dial></Response>
  - If contractor not found: return TwiML with apology message
  - The /status endpoint handles the no-answer detection

Build src/app/api/twilio/status/route.ts:
  - Accept POST from Twilio status callback
  - Check DialCallStatus: 'no-answer' | 'busy' | 'failed' | 'canceled'
  - If missed:
    → Record start timestamp
    → Call handleMissedCall() from lib/twilio/handle-missed-call.ts
    → This function: creates Lead record, generates AI text, sends SMS,
      notifies contractor, logs response time
    → Record end timestamp, calculate responseTimeMs
    → Target: responseTimeMs < 10000 (10 seconds)
  - If answered: log successful call, no text-back needed

Build src/lib/twilio/handle-missed-call.ts:
  async function handleMissedCall(callerPhone, contractorId, callSid):
    1. Create Lead in Supabase (status: 'new')
    2. Generate AI reply via lib/ai/generate-reply.ts
    3. Send SMS via lib/twilio/send-sms.ts
    4. Create SMSConversation record (direction: OUTBOUND)
    5. Send notifications via /api/notify
    6. Update Lead with responseTimeMs and aiResponseText
    7. Return { success: true, responseTimeMs, leadId }"
```

### Prompt 4: AI Qualification Engine

```jsx
"Build src/lib/ai/generate-reply.ts:
  - Use OpenAI GPT-4o-mini (model: 'gpt-4o-mini')
  - System prompt:
    'You are a friendly assistant for CONTRACTOR_BUSINESS_NAME, a
    BUSINESS_TYPE company in Minneapolis. A customer just called but
    the call was missed. Text them back warmly, apologize briefly, and ask
    what service they need. Keep under 160 chars. Be professional, friendly.
    Never mention AI, automation, or bots. Sound human.'
  - Return the generated text string
  - FALLBACK: If OpenAI call fails, use lib/ai/fallback-templates.ts
    which has pre-written templates per business type:
    HVAC: 'Hi! Sorry we missed your call. How can we help with your
    heating or cooling? Reply here and we will get right back to you.'
    (similar for plumbing, electrical, roofing)
    THE CORE FLOW MUST NEVER DEPEND ON AI BEING AVAILABLE.

Build src/lib/ai/qualify-lead.ts:
  - Handle follow-up SMS conversation (inbound texts from caller)
  - System prompt for qualification:
    'You are qualifying a lead for BUSINESS_NAME. Ask 1-2 short
    questions to understand: (1) what service they need, (2) urgency
    level. Score 1-10. Keep texts under 160 chars. Be conversational.'
  - Business-type-specific questions:
    HVAC: 'Is this for heating, cooling, or maintenance?'
    Plumbing: 'Is this an emergency or can it wait to be scheduled?'
    Electrical: 'Residential or commercial?'
    Roofing: 'Repair, inspection, or full replacement?'
  - Store qualification data as JSON: { score, service_needed, urgency, notes }
  - After qualification complete, send summary to contractor"
```

### Prompt 5: Notification Engine

```jsx
"Build src/app/api/notify/route.ts:
  On new lead capture, notify contractor on ALL channels simultaneously:

  SMS (via Twilio):
    To: CONTRACTOR_PHONE
    Body: 'New lead! CALLER_PHONE needs SERVICE_TYPE.
    Score: SCORE/10. Reply CALL for their number.'

  Email (via Gmail API or Resend):
    Subject: '🛡️ IronClad: New Lead — CALLER_PHONE'
    Body: HTML template with lead card (phone, service, score, time,
    one-click call-back link)

  Slack (via webhook):
    POST to SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL
    Formatted blocks: lead card with all details + action buttons

  Track delivery status per channel in Notification table.
  Retry failed notifications 3x with exponential backoff (1s, 5s, 25s).
  If all channels fail, log critical error to Sentry."
```

### Prompt 6: Stripe Billing

```jsx
"Build Stripe billing at src/app/api/stripe/:

  checkout/route.ts:
  - Create Checkout Sessions combining setup fee + subscription:
    Starter: $149 one-time + $97/mo recurring
    Pro:     $249 one-time + $197/mo recurring
    Premium: $399 one-time + $347/mo recurring
  - Use Stripe line_items with both price types
  - success_url: /dashboard?session_id={CHECKOUT_SESSION_ID}
  - cancel_url: /pricing

  webhook/route.ts:
  - Verify Stripe signature with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
  - Handle events:
    checkout.session.completed → create Contractor, provision Twilio number
    invoice.paid → log payment, keep isActive=true
    customer.subscription.deleted → set isActive=false, remove Twilio forwarding
    invoice.payment_failed → send dunning email, flag account
  - All handlers are idempotent (safe to retry)"
```

## 🔒 Single Source of Truth (SSOT) Policy

<aside>
🔒

**SSOT ENFORCEMENT — NO COPY/PRICING/BRAND DRIFT**
The `constants.ts` file below and the Locked Landing Page Copy above are the **single source of truth** for all brand, pricing, stats, and copy. Every asset — site, ads, emails, sales scripts, Stripe products, pitch decks — MUST pull from these sources. If you change pricing, change it in `constants.ts` and the copy section, then propagate everywhere. Never edit a downstream asset without updating the source first.

**Consistency rule:** Starter/Pro/Premium with setup + monthly pricing must match across: landing page, Stripe Checkout, cold email sequences, pitch decks, onboarding docs, and ROI calculator defaults. If any asset disagrees with `constants.ts`, that asset has a bug.
