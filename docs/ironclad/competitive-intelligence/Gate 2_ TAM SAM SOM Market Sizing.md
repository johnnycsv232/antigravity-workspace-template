# Gate 2: TAM SAM SOM Market Sizing

## Total Addressable Market (TAM)

The Total Addressable Market (TAM) represents the entire revenue opportunity at the largest scale for a product or service. For IronClad, this is the total revenue that could be generated from every HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing contractor in the United States. The table below outlines the number of businesses in each of these trades.

| Trade        | Number of Businesses (US) | Source                                                                                                     |
|--------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HVAC         | 118,433                   | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/heating-air-conditioning-contractors/1945/) |
| Plumbing     | 127,324                   | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/plumbers/1946/)                   |
| Electrical   | 256,995                   | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/electricians/189/)                |
| Roofing      | 102,744                   | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/number-of-businesses/roofing-contractors/198/)         |
| **Total**    | **605,496**               |                                                                                                            |

With the IronClad Pro pricing at $197 per month, the TAM is calculated as follows:

**TAM = Total Contractors x Monthly Price x 12 Months**

**TAM = 605,496 x $197 x 12 = $1,430,816,496**

This calculation reveals a substantial national market for IronClad's services.

## Serviceable Available Market (SAM)

The Serviceable Available Market (SAM) is the segment of the TAM that is within a company's geographical reach and is targeted by its products. For IronClad, the SAM is the total number of HVAC, plumbing, electrical, and roofing contractors in Minnesota, with a focus on the Minneapolis metro area. The table below details the number of businesses in each trade within Minnesota.

| Trade        | Number of Businesses (Minnesota) | Source                                                                                                             |
|--------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| HVAC         | 1,979                            | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/minnesota/heating-air-conditioning-contractors/14215/) |
| Plumbing     | 2,220                            | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/minnesota/plumbers/14216/)                            |
| Electrical   | 4,620                            | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/minnesota/electricians/14129/)                        |
| Roofing      | 2,115                            | [IBISWorld](https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/industry/minnesota/roofing-contractors/14128/)                 |
| **Total**    | **10,934**                       |                                                                                                                    |

**Note:** The request specified filtering by revenue ($1M to $20M) and team size (5 to 50 techs). However, this level of granular data is not readily available from public sources. A search of the Minneapolis Chamber of Commerce business directory for "Contractors" yielded only 21 results, indicating that this is not a comprehensive list for the entire metro area.

## Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

The Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM) is the portion of the SAM that a company can realistically capture. For IronClad, the initial SOM is focused on Hennepin County. A precise calculation of the SOM is challenging due to the lack of a comprehensive, publicly available list of all licensed contractors in Hennepin County. The City of Minneapolis provides lists of licensed contractors, but these do not encompass the entire county and are not in a format that allows for easy aggregation.

Given these data limitations, a practical approach is to set a realistic target for market penetration. For Year 1, a target of acquiring **5 to 10 clients** within Hennepin County is a reasonable goal. This allows for a focused market entry and provides a foundation for future expansion.

## Supporting Research

### The High Cost of Missed Calls

Missed calls represent a significant source of lost revenue for home service contractors. The following statistics underscore the severity of this issue:

> A staggering **62% of calls** to home service companies go unanswered. [1]

> The value of a single service call can range from **$350 to $9,000**, depending on the nature of the job. [2]

> Each missed call can translate to a loss of up to **$1,200**. [3]

### Estimated Annual Revenue Loss

To quantify the financial impact of missed calls, we can create a conservative estimate. Assuming a contractor misses just two calls per day, and the average value of a job is $500, the potential annual revenue loss can be calculated as follows:

**2 calls/day x $500/call x 260 working days/year = $260,000**

This calculation demonstrates the substantial financial incentive for contractors to adopt a solution like IronClad. By capturing and converting these missed opportunities, contractors can significantly boost their annual revenue.
