# Design System: IronClad AI Landing
**Project ID:** pending (set after Stitch MCP project creation)

## 1. Visual Theme & Atmosphere
Dark, technical, and conversion-led with restrained gradients and high signal-to-noise hierarchy. The interface should feel like enterprise software confidence translated into a marketing surface.

## 2. Color Palette & Roles
- **Deep Base** (`#060A16`) - Global background anchor and contrast foundation.
- **Mid Surface** (`#0A1527`) - Secondary background gradients and hero surfaces.
- **Border Line** (`rgba(208, 238, 255, 0.14)`) - Card boundaries and layout separation.
- **Primary Text** (`#F3FCFF`) - Headlines and important labels.
- **Support Text** (`#ACC3D8`) - Body copy and helper text.
- **Conversion Mint** (`#6CFDD7`) - Primary CTA and active highlights.

## 3. Typography Rules
- **Display:** Space Grotesk (bold/semibold), tight line-height, negative tracking for major headlines.
- **Body:** Outfit (regular/medium), high legibility for dense marketing copy.
- **Hierarchy:** Strong contrast between section headings and support paragraphs.

## 4. Component Stylings
* **Buttons:** Rounded pill shape, bold text, clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary.
* **Cards/Panels:** Soft corners, subtle borders, mild glass effect via low-opacity overlays.
* **Sections:** Alternating depth through gradients and border contrast instead of hard color blocks.

## 5. Layout Principles
- Desktop-first with responsive collapse to single-column layout.
- Max-width content container with generous vertical rhythm.
- Clear scan path: problem -> solution -> proof -> offer -> CTA.
